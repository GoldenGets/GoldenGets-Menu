# BusinessControls
Lua script for YimMenu which is useful for your GTA Online progress

Hi, I'm not good at programming and I made this because I was inspired by someone else, I think it might be too late to make and share this script after the disaster happened. But you can read the description below to consider.

## Features

- Switch CEO/President
- Instant Hack
- Remove All CCTV
- Phone Animations
- ATM
- Many Computers...
- Many Cooldowns...
- Many Business Controls...
- Many Business Resupply...
- Many Business Selling...


## Features that need to be updated in the next version

In fact, most of these scripts are independent of the GTA Online update version. However, there are some features that should be updated in the future when GTA Online is updated.

- Switch CEO/President
- Instant Hack
- Dispatch Work Cooldown
- All Auto Resupply
- All Instant Sell
- All Shipment Type Sell
