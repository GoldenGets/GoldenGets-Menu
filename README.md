Lua script for YimMenu which is useful for your GTA Online progress

Hi, I'm not good at programming and I made this because I was inspired by someone else, I think it might be too late to make and share this script after the disaster happened. But you can read the description below to consider.

## Features

This script does not need to be updated because it uses Tunables Variables that are not dependent on the update version.



## Features that need updating

but there are also some features that should be updated in the future when GTA Online is updated. list that might expire on the next update:

- Auto Resupply
- Instant Sell
- Shipment Type Sell
