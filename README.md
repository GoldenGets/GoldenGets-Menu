Lua script for YimMenu which is useful for your GTA Online progress

Hi, I'm not good at programming and I made this because I was inspired, I think it might be too late to make and share this script because it's more vulnerable to being banned after the launch of BE but you can read the description below to consider.

## Features
This script does not need to be updated because it uses Tunables Variables that are not dependent on the update version, but there are also some features that should be updated in the future when GTA Online is updated. list that might expire on the next update:

- Auto Resupply
- Instant Sell
- Shipment Type Sell

> [NOTE!!!]
> **Discontinued** due to a series of unfortunate events including what happened to our beloved YimMenu as well as some shitty life circumstances. I will not update this small project anymore but pull requests are still welcome.
> 
> If you want to borrow code, feel free to do so. The only requirement is that you mention the author.
