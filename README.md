## Features that need to be updated in the next version

In fact, most of these scripts are independent of the GTA Online update version. However, there are some features that should be updated in the future when GTA Online is updated.

- Switch CEO/President
- Instant Hack
- Dispatch Work Cooldown
- All Auto Resupply
- All Instant Sell
- All Shipment Type Sell
