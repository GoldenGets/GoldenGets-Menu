Lua script for YimMenu which is useful for your GTA Online progress

Hi, I'm not good at programming and I made this because I was inspired by someone else, I think it might be too late to make and share this script after the disaster happened. But you can read the description below to consider.

## features that need updating
This script does not need to be updated because it uses Tunables Variables that are not dependent on the update version, but there are also some features that should be updated in the future when GTA Online is updated. list that might expire on the next update:

- Auto Resupply
- Instant Sell
- Shipment Type Sell
