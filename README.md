# BusinessControls
Lua script for YimMenu about control business

Hi, I'm not good at programming and I made this because I was inspired, I think it might be too late to make and share this script because it's more vulnerable to being banned after the launch of BE but you can read the description below to consider.

This script uses tunables variables that don't need to be updated on the script and are useful for your GTA Online progress, but there are also some local variables that must be updated in the future when GTA Online updates.

list that might expire on the next update:

- Auto Resupply
- Instant Sell
- Shipment Type Sell
